# Project Overview
> Our idea is a general appointment app that we will call (insert name here) with the intention of helping any person to have an easy way to contact small or big businesses around them. We will have some locations already in the app for convenience. There will also be a calendar side feature to give notifications when the appointment they made is close.  
> There will be some extra adjustments over time that will be added to make sure the app is easy to navigate and understand. The main core will be in providing a fast and easy interface for people. In order to see if they find what they are looking for or find something they did not know needed.
